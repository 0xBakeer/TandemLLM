# Which processes are engines (OPS-18). Sourced by stop.sh, hold.sh, watchdog.sh and gate.sh.
#
# They used to ask `pgrep -f "server/app.py ..."`, which matches any process whose command line
# merely CONTAINS the text: on 2026-09-23 at 22:47 a lock holder, `flock -o LOCK bash -c "<script
# text naming server/app.py>"`, was taken for the engine -- a hold's restore refused to restart
# :8000 because of it, and the next hold's stop.sh sent it SIGTERM, which freed the box lock while
# that hold's command ran. A flock, an ssh session's `bash -c`, a grep or an editor all match.
#
# An engine is a process whose EXECUTABLE is a Python interpreter (/proc/<pid>/exe) and whose
# argument vector runs the script server/app.py: `python [-u ...] server/app.py ...`, the path
# relative or ending in /server/app.py -- what start.sh, the systemd unit and row3 all launch.
# `python -c "..."` and `python tools/x.py --server server/app.py` are not engines. The port is the
# `--port` argument, app.py's default 8000 when there is none. No pid file: a service started by
# an older start.sh, by hand or by row3 is still found.
#
# ENGINE_PROC exists so tests/test_ops_scripts.py can hand the scripts a process table of its own
# (and never the box's real one, which holds the operator's engine).
