# raced -- cron's watchdog and a hold's own restore -- it stopped one engine, reported success, and
# left the other loading; the next thing to look at :8000 saw nothing answering and concluded the
# port was free. A stop that leaves a process behind is worse than one that fails.
# Engines only (OPS-18): a pattern over command lines took a lock holder that mentioned the path for
# one, and SIGTERM to that flock freed the box lock in the middle of a hold.
