"""Choosing the BLOCK LENGTH once per step, and the drafter that goes with it.

Phase 5 measured both lengths on the same five prompts, with the reasoning block closed, and the
table is the whole argument for this file:

| workload | fine-tuned, 8 | fine-tuned, 16 |
|---|---|---|
| prose | 2.75 / 18.53 | 2.36 / 14.24 |
| chat  | 3.94 / 26.56 | 3.86 / 23.15 |
| code  | 5.45 / 36.95 | 6.10 / 36.55 |
| edit  | 7.64 / 52.62 | 13.26 / 80.56 |
| quote | 8.00 / 55.77 | 14.86 / 89.51 |

A sixteen-wide block verifies for 132.38 ms against an eight-wide one's 116.22, and its draft costs
about 32 ms against 26, so it has to commit **15.6 %** more tokens to break even. On `edit` it
commits 74 % more and on `quote` 86 %; on `prose` it commits 14 % fewer. Neither length is right,
and which one is right is a property of the text being written rather than of the model -- so the
engine should be choosing it, per step, and it needs no training to do so.

**The asymmetry that makes this cheap.** A block of sixteen that accepted `n` tokens tells you
exactly what a block of eight would have done with the same draft: `min(n, 7)`. The narrower block
is a prefix of the wider one, the verify pass computes the same rows for it, and the target's argmax
at row `i` does not depend on rows after `i`. So **every wide block scores the narrow option for
free**, and coming back down never costs an experiment.

The other direction is censored. A block of eight that accepted all seven is an observation that
the truth was "at least seven"; what sixteen would have committed is not in the data at all. That is
the 11:03 trap in a new costume -- *a policy that only learns about the option it took keeps taking
it* -- and the only honest fix is to pay for the information. So the router explores upward, and the
rate at which it explores is driven by the one signal that says information is worth buying: how
often the narrow block is hitting its own ceiling.

Three cheap signals, in the order they matter:

1. **the ceiling rate** -- the fraction of recent narrow blocks that accepted every slot. On `quote`
   this is 1.00 and on `prose` it is ~0.00, which is the regime distinction the table is made of;
2. **the free counterfactual** -- `min(n, 7)` on every wide block, which prices the narrow option
   without running it;
3. **the drafter's own lattice** -- once the wide drafter has run, the path probability of slots 8
   to 15 says whether the far half of the block is worth submitting at all, and that decision is
   free because the draft has already been paid for.

Everything is priced on the measured curve -- `verify(w)` from `tools/profile_block.py`, the draft
cost timed around the call the router itself makes, and the verify cost re-learned from the decode
loop that pays it (`on_verify`), because a policy constant belongs to the loop that pays it and a
microbenchmark once read a rollback at 23.4 ms that the loop reads at 6.4.

        Three conditions have to hold at once before the router comes down, and each of them is

        1. **The narrow arm must not be censored.** `ceiling` is the fraction of recent blocks in
           which the narrow width would have accepted every slot it had -- measured on wide blocks
           as well as narrow ones, so the signal exists even when the narrow arm never runs. A
           narrow block that saturates is an observation that says "at least seven" and nothing
           more, and its own measured value is a lower bound being read as an estimate.
        2. **There must be evidence at all.** With neither arm's history and no counterfactual the
           only honest choice is the one that prices both, which is the wide one.
        3. **The narrow arm must be strictly better by `narrow_margin`.** Not merely better: the
           two widths now cost within about one per cent of each other, so an unmargined
           comparison turns measurement noise into a policy, and the narrow number is the
           optimistic one of the two for the reason `narrow_margin` documents.

        Going back up needs no schedule under this rule, because the router is already there. What
        it does need is a way back from a narrow stretch that has gone stale, and that is the same
