"""A draft tree, and the one layout property that lets a linear-attention model verify it.

A chain drafter proposes `t1 t2 t3`; a tree drafter proposes `t1 -> {t2a, t2b}`, and on this board
that is nearly free. The measured verify curve is `V(N) = 149.1 ms + 1.896 ms * N`, so a node is
worth adding when it has about a 5 % chance of extending the accepted prefix.
That is a much lower bar than on a server, where a verify pass is compute-bound and width costs
real time.

**The layout rule.** Nodes are stored in DFS pre-order, so every node's index is greater than its
parent's and each subtree occupies a contiguous range. That is not a convenience. For the 48 Gated
DeltaNet layers, tree verification is a *mask change* to the UT factorisation the chunked kernel
already runs, and the forward substitution in `solve_tril` is only valid if the ancestor-masked
matrix is strictly lower triangular -- which holds exactly when every ancestor has a lower index
than its descendant. DFS pre-order guarantees it; breadth-first order does not.

This module is the contract two drafters have to agree on before their candidates can share one
verify call: the lookup drafter's tree (`engine/drafters/ngram.py`) and the block drafter's lattice.
`merge` is the graft operation -- one tree, two sources, rather than a router choosing between them.

Nothing here touches the GPU or torch, so it is all testable on a laptop; the mask this produces is
consumed by the verify path, which is not written yet.

    """ENG-109: a sampled request's tree -- the drafter's SAMPLED chain as the spine, each spine node
    carrying the distribution it was drawn from, and deterministic siblings from the lattice.

    The walk accepts a spine node by rejection sampling against its q (`min(1, p/q)`), then draws
    from the residual and follows any child carrying the draw (engine/sample.py `tree_walk`). That is
    recursive rejection sampling with the siblings as deterministic candidates, and it is exact only
    if, wherever the walk stands on the spine, the next spine token is still distributed as its q.
    So the construction is causal: the siblings at depth i depend on the lattice and on the spine
    tokens at depths i-1 and i (the candidates at slot i-1 given the predecessor, minus the spine's
    own token), never on a deeper spine token, and every spine node is always in the tree. The
    per-level counts `quota` are decided before the spine is drawn (`level_quota` of the
    deterministic tree the same lattice builds), so the size never depends on the draw either:
    `len(spine) + sum(quota)` drafted nodes at most. Siblings are leaves. A spine token that is not
    among its slot's candidates gives the level below it no siblings (there is no lattice row for
    it), which is again decided by tokens at depth <= i.

    `cand[l][c]` is the c-th candidate token at slot l, `logp[l][p][c]` is the log probability of
    candidate c given that slot l-1 took candidate p (for slot 0 every predecessor row is the
    anchor, so row 0 is the one that means anything), and `greedy[l]` is the candidate index the
    released greedy walk took at slot l.

    Two decisions, both from measurements already in the ledger.

    **The greedy path goes in first, whatever its score.** The 10:28 entry measured the exact
    maximiser of the selector's own objective -- Viterbi -- accepting 3.22 tokens a block against
    greedy's 4.30. What a verify pays for is the expected accepted PREFIX, in which slot 0
    multiplies every later term, and a path maximiser will happily trade slot 0 away for a better
    total. Greedy's slot 0 is the head's own top-1, the most reliable single signal in the lattice.

    **The rest is best-first on path probability.** A node's path probability is its parent's times
    a conditional, so priorities fall monotonically down any path; popping in descending order
    therefore yields the highest-probability ancestor-closed set of nodes of that size, which is
    exactly the set that maximises the expected accepted length for a given budget.

    Pure Python and no torch, so the simulator scores the tree the engine will actually build --
    `tools/sim_draft.py` and `engine/drafters/dflash2.py` call this same function.
