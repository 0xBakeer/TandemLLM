"""The suffix memory, second version: two stores, counted candidates, and a tree instead of a chain.

Version one (`engram.py`) kept one dictionary per n-gram order over the current sequence and
returned the single continuation that followed the most recent occurrence of the longest match. It
worked -- 46-100 % of its drafts were accepted -- and it fired on 8 % of steps.
Coverage, not precision, was the whole problem: an exact n-gram of order >= 3 rarely recurs inside
128 fresh tokens of a 300-token context.

Three changes follow from that, and they are the difference between this file and the old one.

**A second store, and it is much larger than the first.** Besides the per-sequence index over
prompt plus output, there is a static store over a corpus -- code, prose, transcripts, the model's
own past outputs. It is a suffix array over a token array, both memory-mapped, built once by
`tools/build_corpus.py`. Asking it costs three binary searches; it holds tens of millions of tokens
and it is the answer to "has this n-gram ever occurred", rather than "has it occurred since this
request started". This board has ~90 GB of unused unified memory, so the store is free in the only
currency that matters here.

**Counts, not recency.** Every occurrence of a match contributes a vote, so the drafter knows the
difference between a continuation seen once and one seen forty times, and it can say how much
agreement there was. That number is what the firing policy and the node budget are decided by; the
old drafter had no such signal and the router that consumed it was estimating acceptance from
single-digit sample counts.

**A tree, not a chain.** When the context is ambiguous the store usually knows the two or three
things that could come next, and on this board a second candidate costs 1.9 ms against a 151 ms
step. The output is a `DraftTree`, which is also the shape the block drafter's lattice will be
merged into -- one verify call, two sources.

Costs nothing in weights, which is the point: on a step where this drafter fires, the block costs
the verify pass and nothing else. A lookup against a 38-million-token store measures 0.20 ms, against
a verify step of 126 ms.

WHAT THE MEASUREMENT SAID ABOUT THAT FIRST PARAGRAPH
-----------------------------------------------------
Coverage was the wrong diagnosis, or rather it was the right diagnosis of the wrong problem. The
corpus does raise the fire rate, 6.2 % to 9.1 %, and it lowers the accepted tokens per fired block
from 1.80 to 1.40. Tuned for throughput rather than for coverage the policy goes the other way: it
fires on 2.6 % of steps and gets 3.2 tokens when it does.

The reason is the alternative. A step this drafter declines is not a step lost, it is a step the
prediction head takes, and that head costs 4 ms with a trimmed vocabulary and delivers about one
token. A wrong proposal from here costs a whole verify plus a 23 ms rollback. So the bar is not
"has this n-gram occurred", it is "has it occurred often enough that I will beat a cheap neural
drafter", and that bar is high. `min_order` tunes to 5 and `min_corpus_order` to 7.

Where it does pay it pays enormously: on an editing workload the router with this drafter runs at
45.1 tok/s against 25.2 for the head alone. It is a specialist, and the firing policy exists to keep
it from pretending otherwise.

No text is stored here, only token ids, and the corpus store is built on the box and never leaves
it.
