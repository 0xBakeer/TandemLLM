"""DFlash2: a block drafter that proposes a whole masked block in one non-causal pass.

The module is `z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2`: five non-causal decoder layers of its own (hidden 5120,
32 query / 8 KV heads, head_dim 128, intermediate 17408, rope_theta 1e7, full 128-dim rotary), a
fusion projection `fc` over five of the target's hidden states, a dynamic depthwise convolution
wrapped around each sublayer, and a bigram candidate selector. It has no embedding table and no
head: the noise block is embedded with the *target's* `embed_tokens` and the draft hidden states are
turned into tokens by the *target's* `lm_head`.

WHICH TARGET HIDDEN STATES, AND FROM WHERE
------------------------------------------
`dflash_config.target_layer_ids = [5, 19, 33, 47, 61]`, and those ids are consumed by the serving
stack as *capture points at the entry of that layer*, not as that layer's output. The target model
marks the listed layers and each marked layer captures inside
`LayerCommunicator.prepare_attn_and_capture_last_layer_outputs`, whose body is:

    hidden_states, residual = self.prepare_attn(hidden_states, residual, ...)
    if captured_last_layer_outputs is not None:
        gathered_last_layer_output = self._communicate_simple_fn(hidden_states=residual, ...)
        ...
        captured_last_layer_outputs.append(gathered_last_layer_output)

`prepare_attn` is the fused add-norm: it folds the incoming `hidden_states` into `residual` and
writes `input_layernorm(residual)` into `hidden_states`. What is appended is **`residual`** -- the
residual stream *entering* layer L, i.e. the output of layer L-1 *after* its MLP residual add and
*before* layer L's `input_layernorm`. The name of the helper says it: "capture_last_layer_outputs".

So the five tensors this drafter needs are the residual stream entering target layers
5, 19, 33, 47 and 61, concatenated in that (ascending) order into [N, 5 * 5120] and fed to `fc`.

In this engine that is exactly what `Qwen38Engine.tap` already hands out. `forward()` calls
`self.tap(h[0].detach())` once with the embedding -- the residual stream entering layer 0 -- and
once at the end of every layer, after `h = res + self.mlp(x, p)` -- the residual stream entering the
next layer. Tap invocation number j is therefore "the residual stream entering layer j", and
invocations 5, 19, 33, 47, 61 are the five tensors, with no host-side change at all. See
`# REQUIRED HOST CHANGES` below for the one thing that is *not* required but would be tidier.

THE BLOCK
---------
`block_size = 8`. The block the draft module runs on is

    ids       = [anchor, MASK, MASK, MASK, MASK, MASK, MASK, MASK]      (mask id 248070)
    positions = [p,      p+1,  p+2,  p+3,  p+4,  p+5,  p+6,  p+7]

where `anchor` is the last token the target decided and `p` is its position -- the serving worker
builds precisely this (`block_ids.fill_(mask_token_id); block_ids[:, 0].copy_(bonus_tokens)`,
`positions = prefix_lens + [0..block_size-1]`).

Row j of the module's output predicts the token at position p+j, so **row 0 is dead** (its token is
the anchor, already known) and one block yields `block_size - 1 = 7` proposals, not 8:

    draft_hidden = draft_hidden.view(bs, block_size, -1)
    pred_hidden  = draft_hidden[:, 1:, :]            # [bs, block_size-1, H]
    ...
    draft_tokens[:, 0].copy_(block_ids[:, 0]); draft_tokens[:, 1:].copy_(draft_next)

That matches `engine/spec.py` one for one: the verify pass runs `[tok] + draft` with
`len(draft) == 7`, and an all-accept block yields 7 drafted tokens plus the bonus.

CONTEXT ENTERS AS KV, NOT AS TOKENS
-----------------------------------
`target_hidden` is projected once, `hidden_norm(fc(target_hidden))`, and that single tensor is what
every one of the five layers projects its context K and V from -- the HF reference passes the same
`target_hidden` into every layer, and the serving worker materialises it into the draft KV cache
once per committed token:

    ctx_hidden = self.draft_model.project_target_hidden(target_hidden)
    for layer in self.draft_model.layers:
        k, v = layer.self_attn.kv_proj_only(ctx_hidden)
        k = attn.apply_k_norm(k); k = attn.apply_k_rope(positions, k)

So the context costs `k_proj + v_proj` per layer per committed token, paid in `sync()`, and the
draft pass itself only ever projects Q from the eight noise rows. Q comes from the noise block, K
and V from context concatenated with the noise block, which is the KV injection the reference
names.

Attention is **non-causal**: `config.is_causal = false` maps to `AttentionType.ENCODER_ONLY`, so
inside the block every row sees every other row, including later ones -- that is what makes this a
block drafter rather than seven chained steps. All five layers are `sliding_attention` with
`sliding_window = 2048`, applied to the context side.

NORM CONVENTION -- THE THING THAT IS EASY TO GET WRONG
------------------------------------------------------
The target uses `GemmaRMSNorm`, `normalize(x) * (1 + w)`, which is what `engine.model.rms_norm`
implements. The draft checkpoint does **not**: it is a Qwen3 draft (`Qwen3RMSNorm` in the HF
reference, sglang's plain `RMSNorm` whose weight is initialised to `ones`) and computes
`normalize(x) * w`. Every norm in this file therefore uses the local `_rms`, never the engine's.
`tools/dflash2_probe.py` checks this empirically: the checkpoint's norm weights sit near 1.0, which
only makes sense for the plain convention.

        7 slots x (16 successor + 16 predecessor) rows x 256 x 2 B =      114,688 B

                                                                   --------------
    total                                                           6,137,440,768 B = 6.14 GB

    -> 22.5 ms at the board's 273 GB/s, 32.3 ms at the 190 GB/s a real kernel reaches; 3.2 ms and
       4.6 ms per proposal. `tools/dflash2_probe.py` prints this table from the checkpoint itself.

The whole checkpoint is 1,924,404,480 params / 3.849 GB, of which 254.3 MB is the two codebooks --
resident, and read 2,217x more sparsely than their size suggests.

Against `notes/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 1.4: MTP-3 moves 9.1 GB for 3 proposals, this moves 6.14 GB
for 7. Against a 26.93 GB verify step it is 23 % of a step for up to 8 accepted tokens.

THE SELECTOR DOES NOT REPLACE THE HEAD READ
-------------------------------------------
It is an inference-time device -- the serving worker runs it on every draft, greedy and sampling
alike -- but it *consumes* the head's output instead of avoiding it. `compute_candidates` runs the
full head and then takes the top k:

    def _project_candidate_logits(hidden, lm_head, *, num_org, use_quant_head):
        weight = lm_head.weight
        return torch.matmul(hidden.to(weight.dtype), weight[:num_org].T)
    ...
    def _radix_topk(scores, k):
        # The selector's largest single cost: it reads the whole logits tensor.

and the codebooks are then *gathered* by candidate id, 32 rows of 256 per slot. So the whole
2,542,796,800 B of `lm_head` is read either way; the selector adds 2,621,440 B for
`hidden_projection` and 114,688 B of gathers, 0.04 % of the draft, and buys acceptance rather than
bytes: it rescores the 16 candidates per slot against the previous slot's choice through a rank-256
bigram factorisation and walks the resulting lattice.

The 33 ms / 6 ms difference is a *different* lever and it is still available: replacing the target's
head with a reduced-vocabulary draft head, the way `MTPDrafter` already can, takes the draft from
6.14 GB to 3.76 GB (32k fp8 rows = 167,772,160 B), 13.8 ms at 273 GB/s. The selector is unaffected -- it
indexes its codebooks by global token id, so a reduced head only has to map its rows back. That
path is wired here behind `draft_head=`, off by default until `tools/draft_head.py` exists.

WHAT IS NOT IN THE REFERENCE
----------------------------
`blocks=2` (two chained 8-wide drafts, 14 proposals) has no counterpart in the serving stack. The
worker runs exactly one draft forward per verify; the only supported way to propose more is a larger
`block_size` (`speculative_num_draft_tokens` overrides the checkpoint's 8 and `set_block_size`
re-blocks the convolutions). The chaining implemented below is therefore this engine's own, and its
shape is stated where it is built.
"""

# REQUIRED HOST CHANGES
# ---------------------
# None. `Qwen38Engine.tap` already delivers the five tensors this drafter needs, at the point it
# needs them, and `engine/spec.py` already calls `sync(tokens, hidden, first_pos)` after every
# verified block with `first_pos` equal to the position of `tokens[0]`. This drafter ignores
# `sync`'s `hidden` argument -- that one is the post-final-norm hidden, which is what the MTP head
# wants and not what DFlash2 wants -- and reads its own tap buffer instead.
#
# Two changes would be improvements rather than requirements, and neither is made here:
#
#   1. `eng.tap` is a single slot, so two drafters that both need it cannot be resident at once
#      (`engine/router.py` switches between drafters, and a future tap consumer would silently
#      steal this one). The patch, if that day comes:

#
#      Passing the index explicitly would also remove this file's need to count invocations.
#
#   2. `forward()` taps all 65 layers unconditionally once `tap` is set. Handing the engine the set
#      of wanted indices (`eng.tap_layers = {5, 19, 33, 47, 61}`) would let it skip the 60 calls
#      whose result is dropped. They are `detach()` views, so the cost today is 60 Python calls per
#      forward and no memory traffic -- not worth a host edit on its own.

        1280 features laid out [side][tap][group], which is the reshape order used here.
      * direction -- `F.pad(blocks[:-tap], (..., tap, 0))` pads the *front* of the token axis, so
        `shifted[t] = blocks[t - tap]`. The convolution looks backwards: it is causal.
      * blocking -- `position` is the index *within* the block, and the `position >= tap` mask kills
        every tap that would reach across a block boundary. A block never sees the one before it.

        rather than a draft conditioned on positions that stopped being written -- and drop the

        **What it deliberately does NOT do is free anything**, and both halves of that are

        CONTEXT -- 655 MB an arm at the shipped `--max-len 32768` -- and it goes back to a caching
        allocator pool that nothing else on this board can spend: the state store's budget is set

        `torch.zeros` over 655 MB, twice, at the next request's first sync: about 6 ms of that
        request's time to first token, every request, for memory nobody asked for. It also makes
        `/health`'s `allocated` oscillate by 655 MB a request, which is the one number that is
        supposed to mean a leak.

        `free_cache=True` does it anyway, for measuring that claim rather than believing it.

        step, so the question is not whether width is worth it but how much of it to buy.

        The construction is best-first over path probability under a node budget, seeded with the
        released greedy walk. The seeding is not a detail: the ledger's 10:28 entry measured the
        exact maximiser of the selector's own score -- Viterbi -- accepting 3.22 tokens a block
        against greedy's 4.30, because what a verify pays for is the expected accepted PREFIX, in
        which slot 0 multiplies every later term, and a maximiser will trade slot 0 away for a
        better total. Greedy's slot 0 is the head's own top-1, the single most reliable signal in
        the lattice, so the greedy path goes in first and the budget buys alternatives around it.

        Best-first is exactly right for the rest: a node's path probability is its parent's times a
        conditional, so priorities fall monotonically down any path, and popping in descending order
        yields the highest-probability ancestor-closed set of nodes there is -- which is the set
