"""DSpark: the same block-drafter shape as DFlash2, a different backbone, and two extra heads.

`Doopeworld/Qwen3.8-27B-DSpark-vLLM`. The published claim is 16-18 % more accepted tokens a block
than DFlash on the same target (notes/RESEARCH-GROK-specdec-0917.md), and the reason to care here
is that the median of this engine's row is fresh prose, where the shipped drafter accepts 2.7 of a
sixteen-token block and everything phase 6 bought landed on the other half of the row.

WHAT IT SHARES WITH DFlash2, AND WHY THIS FILE IS SHORT
-------------------------------------------------------
The reference (`dspark.py` / `dflash.py` in the checkpoint) makes `DSparkDraftModel` a subclass of
SpecForge's `DFlashDraftModel`, and that base is the same construction `engine/drafters/dflash2.py`
already implements: no embedding and no head of its own, a `fc` over five captured target hidden
states through `hidden_norm`, five non-causal decoder layers whose K and V come from BOTH the
projected context and the noise block, and a block of `[anchor, MASK, MASK, ...]` whose rows
1.. are the proposals. So the module here is `DFlash2Module` with three things changed and the
drafter is `DFlash2Drafter` with two.

WHAT IS DIFFERENT, ALL OF IT LOAD-BEARING
-----------------------------------------
1. **No dynamic convolution and no candidate selector.** The z-lab DFlash2 checkpoint wraps every
   sublayer in a dynamic depthwise convolution and carries a bigram lattice over 16 candidates a
   slot; this one has neither. `DFlash2Config` already reads that off the config (`conv_kernel_size`
   and `selector_rank` both absent -> 0), and both code paths already test for it, so nothing here
   has to say so. What it costs is the tree: with no lattice there are no alternatives to put in
   one, and `propose_tree` returns a chain. On this board that is a real loss -- phase 6 measured
   the tree at +40.8 % on the row -- and it is why DSpark is offered as a THIRD ARM rather than a
   replacement: the length router can send fresh prose to it and reproduction to the tree.

2. **YaRN rotary.** `rope_parameters.rope_type = "yarn"`, factor 32 over an original 8,192-position
   window, `beta_fast` 32 and `beta_slow` 1. This is not a long-context detail that can be skipped
   at short lengths: YaRN rescales the inverse frequencies at EVERY position and multiplies cos and
   sin by an attention factor, so a drafter run with plain RoPE is not a slightly worse drafter, it
   is a drafter reading its own positions wrong. Implemented in `_yarn_inv_freq` against the HF
   `_compute_yarn_parameters` it was trained under.

3. **Block size 7**, so six proposals a block against DFlash2's seven at block 8 and fifteen at
   block 16, and a different mask token (248077).

4. **Two heads the DFlash2 checkpoint does not have.**

   * `markov_head` -- a rank-256 learned bigram bias, `markov_w2(markov_w1(prev_token))`, added to
     the draft logits. It conditions slot j on the token at slot j-1, which at training time is
     teacher-forced and at inference time is whatever the drafter itself proposed there. The
     reference's own `spec_generate` does not apply it (it is the DFlash base's loop), so the
     inference-time reading is this file's: run the block once unbiased, take the proposals, and
     use them as the previous tokens for one refinement pass. That is the natural fixed-point step
     and it costs one read of `markov_w2` -- 127 MB, about 0.6 ms -- for the whole block rather
     than one per slot. `--markov 0` turns it off and the A/B says what it was worth.

   * `confidence_head` -- one linear over [hidden, markov latent] predicting whether each slot will
     be accepted. Nothing here consumes it yet; it is computed and exposed as `last_conf` because
     an adaptive block length is exactly what the length router already is, and the router's
     current evidence is the arm's own accept history rather than a per-block prediction. Wiring
     it is a measurement, not a port, and it is left for one.

NOTHING HERE CAN CHANGE WHAT THE ENGINE WRITES. A drafter proposes; the target verifies every
proposal against its own argmax. A DSpark block that is wrong costs a rollback and nothing else,
which is why this file has no losslessness argument of its own -- `tools/verify_spec.py` runs the
same gate against it that every other drafter passes.
