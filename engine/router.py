"""Choosing a drafter, and a draft length, once per step.

Two drafters with opposite cost structures are available. A suffix memory proposes long blocks for
nothing but only where the context repeats itself, which on this board is 5-10 % of steps. The
checkpoint's prediction head proposes on every step but reads 3.0 GB per token it proposes -- about
17 ms, against a verify step of 151-180 ms -- so a draft it gets wrong is not free.

The choice is an expected-value calculation, not a heuristic, and every term in it is something the
engine has already measured:

    value(drafter, m)  =  E[accepted | drafter, m] / (verify(m + 1) + cost(drafter, m))

`verify` is the measured verify curve; `cost` is zero for the suffix memory and
linear in m for the prediction head; `E[accepted]` is estimated from that drafter's own recent
history, and for the suffix memory it is conditioned on the length of the match it found, which is
the one signal available before committing.

The router deliberately sees nothing about what the text says. It sees match lengths, recent
acceptance and block economics.

    """Spend one block's node budget across a lookup tree and the block drafter's chain.

    The first router's measured defect was not its shape but its evidence: it estimated the suffix
    memory's acceptance from single-digit sample counts, and on the steps where it guessed wrong it
    spent a whole verify on a lookup that did not pay (-0.8 tok/s on prose, -2.2 on edit). Two
    things fix that, and neither is a heuristic.

    **The estimate comes from the drafter, not from a counter.** `NgramDrafter` returns a tree whose
    scores are path probabilities, so the expected accepted length of its proposal is a number it
    computes per step from the counts it actually found. All the router has to learn is one scalar:
    how optimistic those probabilities have been lately. A single calibration factor needs far less
    evidence than a per-drafter acceptance rate.

    **Nothing is winner-take-all once the verify path can take a tree.** Merging costs the union of
    the two proposals -- shared prefixes are shared nodes -- and at 1.896 ms per node a wrong lookup
    costs a few milliseconds instead of a step. Until `forward_tree` exists the router still has to
    pick a chain, and then it picks the one with the higher expected value under the measured curve;
    `propose_tree` is the same decision with the merge left in, and is what the tree verify will
