"""Choosing a drafter, and a draft length, once per step.

Two drafters with opposite cost structures are available. A suffix memory proposes long blocks for
nothing but only where the context repeats itself, which on this board is 5-10 % of steps. The
checkpoint's prediction head proposes on every step but reads 3.0 GB per token it proposes -- about
17 ms, against a verify step of 151-180 ms -- so a draft it gets wrong is not free.

The choice is an expected-value calculation, not a heuristic, and every term in it is something the
engine has already measured:

    value(drafter, m)  =  E[accepted | drafter, m] / (verify(m + 1) + cost(drafter, m))

`verify` is the measured curve in notes/SPEED-LEDGER.md; `cost` is zero for the suffix memory and
linear in m for the prediction head; `E[accepted]` is estimated from that drafter's own recent
history, and for the suffix memory it is conditioned on the length of the match it found, which is
the one signal available before committing.

The router deliberately sees nothing about what the text says. It sees match lengths, recent
acceptance and block economics.
