"""The gated delta rule and its depthwise causal convolution.

`flash-linear-attention` and `causal_conv1d` are not installed on this board and the interpreter
has no pip, so both are written here. That is not a workaround: the decode path needs a recurrent
step it can capture in a CUDA graph, and block verification needs to run the recurrence over an
arbitrary prefix of a verified block starting from a saved state, and neither is something the
library kernels expose.

Both functions here follow the reference implementation exactly, including the fp32 casts, the
l2 normalisation of q and k, the `1/sqrt(head_dim)` scale applied after it, and the chunk size 64
of the chunked form. `state_shape` is the contract the rest of the engine holds them to.

    Shapes in [B, T, H, D], state [B, H, Dk, Dv] fp32. A copy of `state` is used, never the caller's
    tensor, so the entry state of a speculative block survives the verify pass unchanged.

    `return_factors` additionally hands back the three tensors a *partial* accept needs, and is only
    honoured when the whole call is one chunk -- which every speculative verify is, because the
    caller blocks at the block length. They are the normalised keys, the chunk's cumulative gate,
    and `u`, the pseudo-values the WY transform produces. Their point is this identity:

        S_after_n = exp(gc[n-1]) . S_entry  +  SUM_{t<n} exp(gc[n-1] - gc[t]) . k_t (x) u_t

    `u_t` depends on `S_entry` and on the tokens up to `t` only -- `attn` is unit lower triangular,
    so nothing in row t reads a later row -- and therefore **it does not depend on how many tokens
    of the block are eventually kept**. The state after any prefix is a weighted sum of factors the
    verify pass has already computed, which is a state read and a [Dk, n] x [n, Dv] product per
    layer instead of re-running the recurrence.

    `tree` turns the block into a DRAFT TREE. It is `(ancestor_incl, ancestor_strict)`, two [T, T]
    boolean matrices where row i marks the nodes i may read: its ancestors and itself, and its
    ancestors alone. Three things in the chain form are prefix operations, and each becomes the same
    operation over the ancestor relation instead:

      * the cumulative gate `gc` is a prefix sum along the sequence; on a tree it is the sum along
        the path from the root, which is `ancestor_incl @ g`;
      * the decay between two positions, `exp(gc[i] - gc[j])`, is only meaningful when j is on i's
        path, so it is masked to `ancestor_incl` -- masked *before* the exponential, because
        `gc[i] - gc[j]` for an unrelated j is unbounded above;
      * the UT transform's strictly-lower-triangular `attn` becomes strictly-ancestor-masked.

    That last one is why `engine/tree.py` stores nodes in DFS pre-order and nothing else. The
    ancestor relation is then a subset of the strict lower triangle, so `I - attn` is still unit
    lower triangular and `solve_triangular` is still the right solver -- the tree is a masking
    change to the kernel, not a new algorithm. Because `(I - A)^-1 = I + A + A^2 + ... ` and every
    power of an ancestor-masked matrix is ancestor-masked, row t of the inverse reads only t's own
    path; so `u_t` still depends on nothing below t on its branch, and the factor identity above
    holds for **every root-to-node path in the tree**, which is what makes the commit a gather.

    A tree call must be a single chunk -- the identity is per chunk -- so `chunk_size` must be at
    least T, and no final state is meaningful (a tree has as many final states as leaves). Callers
    take the path they accepted out of the factors.
