"""The verify pass served from CUDA graphs (SPD-29).

`tools/graph_bound.py` measured the prize: the same sixteen-row verify replayed from a captured
graph took 89.2 ms against 97.3 eager, because a graph removes the per-launch gaps on the device --
about 2 us each, several thousand a block -- which a Python host and a native one pay alike. A
verify cannot simply be replayed as captured, though: its position, its context length and, for a
tree, its shape change every block, and a graph bakes every launch argument in. So the verify is
made graph-safe first:

  * the block's positions and `[start, start + T]` live in static device buffers, filled before a
    replay; the rotary tables are gathered at those positions;
  * the KV append is a scatter at the positions (`index_copy_`), and attention reads the whole
    cache buffer with the length from the device (`tools/attn_kernels.py::decode_attention_dev`);
  * a tree's ancestor mask, convolution windows and depths are static buffers per row count;
  * a chain's walked recurrent state goes into a static scratch buffer, the entry state is the live
    one, and the commit rebuilds the live state in place (`tools/gdn_commit_kernels.py`). If the
    caller accepts the whole chain and never commits, the next engine call copies the walked state
    in (`Qwen38Engine._settle`), which is what the eager path would have left.

One graph per (chain or tree, rows, context class), captured lazily into one shared memory pool --
the graphs never run concurrently -- after an eager warm-up of the same graph-safe body. The context
class is the next power of two of the context, from 1,024 to 32,768: past that the attention chunk
grows and the eager path, which cuts the context elsewhere, keeps the verify. Everything the eager
path leaves on the engine is restored after a replay from what the capture recorded: the trace, the
hidden states, and the drafter's tap rows, which are replayed into the tap in order.

Requires the fused commit and the fused GDN verify mixer (the graph-safe recurrence is theirs), the
decode-attention kernel, and a bf16 KV cache; otherwise the eager path runs, unchanged.
