"""The reference forward: correct, readable, and slow enough to be trusted.

Everything faster in this engine is checked against this file. It follows the published
implementation operation for operation, including where a cast to fp32 happens and which of the two
RMS norm conventions a given norm uses, because those are the details that silently cost accuracy:

  * `rms_norm`      -- input / post-attention / final / q / k -- is `normalise(x) * (1 + weight)`
  * `rms_norm_gated` -- the linear-attention output norm      -- is `weight * normalise(x) * silu(z)`

The weights are never dequantised into memory. Projections read the checkpoint's fp8 codes through
`tools.fp8_linear`, which applies the 128x128 block scale to the fp32 accumulator.

# Fused kernels replacing parts of the reference forward. Off unless asked for: each one is a

# (argmax agreement, greedy losslessness) and not only against a stopwatch. `tools/*_kernels.py`
# and `tools/head_gemv.py` each carry a `check()` against the function they replace.
# Four of the five are ON as of 11:55: each one is faster in the engine's own step or verify curve,
# and the whole set passes the losslessness gate of 10:07. `attn` is off because indexing the KV
# groups saves 0.6 ms at one token and costs 2.4 ms at eight. Set any of these to 0 to compare.
#: Skip the recurrent-state clone on a TREE verify, where nothing advances it; see `forward_tree`.
#:
#: OFF in the release candidate, and not because it failed anything. It was predicted at 1.7 ms
#: of a 134 ms block and it is not: measured at
#: 134.613 -> 134.344 ms, about 0.27 ms, which is inside the spread of repeated runs of the same
#: configuration. What it does have is the gates -- the losslessness gate PASSES with it on, and
#: `test_forward_tree`, `test_tree` and `test_cache` are identical either way -- and it removes
#: 151 MB of allocation and 302 MB of traffic per block that the tree path had no use for. It
#: would ship on being unnecessary work rather than on a stopwatch reading. It went into the RC
#: together with `tree_mode = nodes`, the row read differently, and both were reverted -- and then
#: re-running the reverted configuration unchanged read differently again, by more than either
#: change was worth. The row's run-to-run spread is 10 % of its mean when the policy is adaptive,
#: so it cannot resolve a change this size and did not. This is off in the RC because the RC was
#: soaked without it, not because anything caught it, and it goes to the `speed` branch where it
