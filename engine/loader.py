"""Read the checkpoint into device tensors, text model only, fp8 left as codes.

The checkpoint is one safetensors file per layer plus `outside.safetensors` (embeddings, head, final
norm, and the vision tower) and `mtp.safetensors`. The vision tensors are 0.92 GB of a 30.87 GB
checkpoint and this engine never evaluates them, so they are skipped by name.

Quantised projections arrive as a pair -- `X.weight` (fp8 e4m3) and `X.weight_scale_inv` (bf16, one
value per 128x128 block) -- and are kept as that pair in an `FP8Block`. Nothing is dequantised at
load time: the decode step is bandwidth-bound on exactly these bytes.
