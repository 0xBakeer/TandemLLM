"""Deterministic anti-repetition penalties, exact under speculative verification.

The engine decodes greedily and refuses to sample, so when the model's argmax settles on one
token there is nothing in the decoder that can break the loop -- measured 2026-09-18, a "Super
Jump Bros" prompt whose pasted level rows are literal `" C C C …"` strings looped ~7,000 `C`
tokens inside the reasoning block (ENG-17, the diagnosis note in Memo).

The fix is the one vLLM and SGLang ship: penalties on the TARGET's logits, before the argmax.
The property that makes that safe here is the one the whole engine already rests on --
acceptance is everywhere "draft token == target argmax" -- so any deterministic function of the
committed history applied to the row before argmax keeps the speculative path's output identical
to the unspeculated one, *under the same rule*. vLLM applies penalties to the target logits before
the rejection argmax (`v1/sample/rejection_sampler.py`); SGLang does the same in "a relaxed
version" because its verifier is not argmax-exact. This one is exact:

  * chain blocks -- vLLM's per-position history: row i of `[anchor] + draft` is conditioned on
    the committed history plus `draft[:i]`, so rows are penalized left to right, one draft token
    entering the working counts after the row that precedes it;
  * tree blocks -- ancestor history: a node is conditioned on its ANCESTOR PATH, not its
    siblings, and the rows arrive in DFS pre-order, so a depth stack adds each node's token on
    the way down and removes it on the way back up;
  * rollback costs nothing: only accepted tokens are ever committed to the base counts, so a
    rejected block leaves no penalty state behind.

Defaults are the identities -- rep 1.0, presence 0, frequency 0 -- and an off spec short-circuits
every entry point, so a run that does not ask for penalties pays nothing and produces the bytes
it produced before this file existed. The response cache key gains the three values, because
greedy-under-penalties is a different function.

`logit_bias` (SRV-17) rides on the same machinery: OpenAI's `{token: bias}` added to every target
row at every decision site, before the penalties (vLLM's order). It depends on nothing at all, so
the argument above holds a fortiori -- every row, chain, tree or single, gets the same addition,
and "draft == target argmax" stays the acceptance rule.

The pass costs one gather of the touched columns, a batched elementwise pass over
`[rows, touched]`, and one scatter back. Measured on the board at 16 rows and a 120k-token
history: 0.64 ms a block when the history touches 20k distinct tokens (ordinary text), 1.34 ms in
the worst case where every token is distinct -- against a ~99 ms verify. A full-vocab masked pass
was 4.2 ms and is not what runs.

    # The three formulas live in `_apply_matrix` (one code path for every call site):
    # rep is multiplicative (the CTRL/HF form: a negative logit is multiplied by it, a positive
    # one divided by it), presence is a flat subtraction on tokens that occur at all, and
    # frequency subtracts per occurrence. All three touch only columns the history contains,
    # which is what makes presence and frequency differ and what makes rep a no-op on fresh
    # vocabulary.
