"""The chunked gated delta rule at PREFILL, as two kernels instead of two thousand.

`engine/gdn.py::chunk_gated_delta_rule` is the reference implementation's shape, in PyTorch, and it
is written the way the reference is written: every intermediate is a whole tensor. At an 8k prefill,
one GDN layer of this model is H = 48 value heads, Dk = Dv = 128 and 128 chunks of 64, so those
intermediates are

    query, key, value, k_beta, v_beta, k_cumdecay   [1, 48, 128, 64, 128] fp32   201 MB each
    decay_mask, attn, (I - attn)^-1                 [1, 48, 128, 64,  64] fp32   101 MB each

and the pass writes and re-reads about six gigabytes of them per layer, then runs a serial loop of
128 iterations issuing a dozen kernels each. The arithmetic underneath is 71 GFLOP a layer, which
is 2.3 ms on this board. The mixer measures 110-128 ms. Two earlier attempts aimed at the
arithmetic -- a blocking sweep and a precision sweep -- were both negative, and that is why: the
arithmetic was never the cost. **The temporaries and the launches are.**

So this file keeps the same arithmetic in the same order and never writes most of those tensors
down. Two kernels:

`_intra` -- grid (head, chunk), 6,144 independent programs at 8k. Everything inside one chunk that
does not depend on the recurrent state: the l2 normalisation of the keys, the chunk-local
cumulative gate, the decay matrix, the UT transform's strictly-lower `attn`, its inverse, and the
two products the scan needs. `decay_mask` and `attn` are born, used and die in registers; only
`u_beta = (I - attn)^-1 v_beta` and `k_cumdecay` are written out.

**The inverse is a forward substitution, and the cheaper idea was wrong.** `attn` is strictly lower
triangular and therefore nilpotent with `attn^64 = 0`, so `(I - attn)^-1 = SUM_{p<64} attn^p` and six
doublings of `S_2n = S_n + attn^n . S_n` reach it in eleven 64x64 products instead of a batched
triangular solve over 6,144 systems. It is four times cheaper than what ships here and it produces
**NaN on this model**: the series is only stable while the powers of `attn` stay small, and on real
keys they do not. It survives a synthetic check because independent random keys in 128 dimensions
are very nearly orthogonal, so the matrix being inverted is very nearly the identity and every
scheme passes. `check(corr=...)` mixes a common direction into the keys and kills it in one run;
`QWEN38_GDN_PREFILL_SERIES=1` still selects it, so the failure can be reproduced.

What ships instead is `engine/gdn.py`'s own forward substitution -- the loop behind
`QWEN38_UT_INVERSE=0` -- one row at a time in registers, where nothing ever exceeds the size of the
answer.

`_scan` -- grid (head, value block). The only serial part, and the state tile never leaves
registers: for each chunk in order it reads q, k, `u_beta`, `k_cumdecay` and the gate, produces the
chunk's output, and advances `S`. The 128 iterations become one kernel launch per program.

NUMERICS. The tensors and the recurrent state are fp32, in the reference's order. The PRODUCTS are
`bf16x3`: each fp32 operand is split into a bf16 head and a bf16 tail and three of the four cross
terms are kept, which is about sixteen mantissa bits on the tensor cores. That is not a preference,
it is what the board left: Triton's `ieee` runs these shapes on the CUDA cores at fourteen times the
tf32 time and its `tf32x3` at thirty, while plain `tf32` moves the recurrent state by 2.6e-3
relative. The two products that never touch the state -- `q . k^T` and its product with the chunk's
pseudo-values -- stay at `tf32`, because they only ever reach a bf16 output.

The l2 normalisation of q and k is left in PyTorch and in the INPUT dtype, which is where
`engine/gdn.py` does it: redoing it in fp32 inside the kernel would be more accurate and therefore
a different answer, carried to the end of the sequence by the state.

**And on "lossless": at a prefill there is nothing to be lossless against.** `tools/prefill_gate.py
--control` runs the SHIPPED path against ITSELF with its other exact inverse -- `solve_triangular`
against the forward substitution, both already in `engine/gdn.py`, both exact -- and on this model
that moves an 8k prefill's logits by 8.2 bf16 ulp and makes a greedy continuation diverge after ten
tokens. The fused path moves them by 8.7 and diverges after the same ten. Forty-eight recurrent
layers amplify any reordering of the same fp32 to that, and the control is the only honest
yardstick for a kernel that is, by construction, a reordering.
