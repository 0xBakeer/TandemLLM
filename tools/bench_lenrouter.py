"""Fixed eight, fixed sixteen, and the router, on the five workloads, in one process.

The comparison this tool exists for is the one phase 5 could not make: the 17:14 table was three
separate runs of `bench_decode.py`, and the router has to be measured against both fixed lengths on
the same weights, the same prompts and the same allocation history or the comparison is with a
different afternoon.

Both fixed baselines run through `LengthRouter` with `fixed=` set rather than through
`DFlash2Drafter` directly, so the three rows differ in the routing policy and in nothing else --
not in which object holds the tap, not in how many drafters are resident, not in the cost of
keeping two draft caches current. A baseline that does not pay a cost the routed run pays would
flatter the router by exactly that cost.

**Thinking is off.** The template's default is on, the atlas row sends `enable_thinking: false`, and
the difference between the two regimes reached 72 % on the same prompt with the same drafter
(SPEED-LEDGER 15:50). Every number here is the regime the row is measured in.
