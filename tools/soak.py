"""Hours of mixed traffic against a running server, watching for the things a bench cannot see.

The atlas row sends fifty identical-shaped requests to a freshly started process with the caches
off, and it answers one question very well: how fast is a generation. It cannot answer any of the
questions that decide whether this is a thing the operator can leave running:

  * does memory climb -- the state cache, the suffix store, the response cache, the allocator;
  * does the cache budget actually evict, or does it grow until the board is full;
  * do the rates drift as the process ages, and does time-to-first-token drift with them;
  * what happens to a client that arrives while a long generation is in flight;
  * what happens to a client that hangs up half way through a stream;
  * does anything raise, and if it does, does the caller find out.

So the mix here is deliberately unlike the row: five languages of workload, thinking on and off,
single-shot and multi-turn sessions, prompts from forty tokens to twenty-four thousand, several
connections at once, and a fraction of requests that disconnect on purpose. Every request's
outcome is recorded, `/health` is sampled on a timer, and both are reported as a table per
interval so a drift shows up as a trend rather than as a final average.

    python tools/soak.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1 --minutes 120 --concurrency 3

SRV-8 added what a leak verdict needs beyond that. `--csv` writes one row per `/health` sample
(every `--health-every` seconds): the process's RSS, the allocator, the state store's and the
suffix store's counters, and -- when the server runs on this host -- MemFree, MemAvailable and the
page cache from /proc/meminfo. Tool calls (a call, then its result as a `tool` message) and sampled
requests join the mix, and `--long-docs` adds real held-out documents of 8k-32k tokens asked about
twice in one conversation. `--idle-every`/`--idle-for` stop all traffic for a while, as a real day
has gaps. `--probe-docs` measures the rate the same way at the start, every `--probe-every`
seconds and at the end, with the traffic paused and a 2k document the server has never seen
("continue the text", greedy), so an end-against-start comparison is not a comparison of what the
suffix store has learnt; `--server-log` adds each probe's tokens and milliseconds a block from the
server's own `[req]` line.
