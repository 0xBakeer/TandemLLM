"""The same W4A16 product as `tools/nvfp4_linear.py`, with the activation read rewritten.

The v1 kernel loses more than a third of its rate between one row and sixteen: 186 GB/s at M = 1
and 127 at M = 16 on a cold 2.96 GB chain, and 139 GB/s in the engine's own verify pass where the
fp8 `lm_head` holds 217 on the same block. The tile table phase 7 built does not close it, and the
reason it cannot is that the loss is not in the tiling.

It is in how `x` is read. v1's `_chunk_dot` loads the activation twice per 32-wide K chunk:

    xe = tl.load(x_base + 2 * tl.arange(0, 16))          # logical K 0, 2, 4, ... 30
    xo = tl.load(x_base + 2 * tl.arange(0, 16) + 1)      # logical K 1, 3, 5, ... 31

Those are **strided gathers of 2-byte elements at a 4-byte pitch**, eight of them per 128-wide K
step, each covering BLOCK_M rows. At M = 1 fifteen of sixteen rows are masked away and the gather
costs almost nothing; at M = 16 every row is live and the kernel issues sixteen times the
uncoalesced accesses. That is the whole M curve, and it explains why it is a curve rather than a
step: it is linear in the number of live rows.

v2 reads the same 128 logical K values as ONE contiguous 256-byte-per-row tile and does the
even/odd split in registers, the way v1 already splits the weight bytes:

    xt      = tl.load(x_base + q * 128 + tl.arange(0, 128))   # [BLOCK_M, 128], coalesced
    xe, xo  = tl.split(tl.reshape(xt, [BLOCK_M, 64, 2]))      # register shuffle, no memory

and then, because a dot product does not care in what order K is summed, it never puts the halves
back in logical order. The weight tile decodes to the same two halves, the group scales are
broadcast onto the decoded weight (exact: e2m1 has two significand bits, e4m3 has three, fp16
holds ten), and the product is taken as either

  * `DOTS = 1` -- one `tl.dot` at K = 128 over the concatenation [even | odd], or
  * `DOTS = 2` -- two `tl.dot` at K = 64, one per half, which skips the two concatenations,

against v1's **eight** `tl.dot` at K = 16 per 128-wide K step, one per NVFP4 scale group half.

At M = 1 the gather v2 removes was nearly free -- fifteen of sixteen rows masked away -- and v2 is
ahead there anyway, 203 against 185 GB/s, because `split_k` goes with it. `pick_config_v2` covers M = 1..32.

# From the cold sweep in notes/SPEED-LEDGER.md, phase 8: every projection on a 2-3 GB chain of
# distinct weights, M = 1..32, against v1's shipped decode tile. Two things came out of it and the
# second is the larger.
#
#   * v2 beats v1 at the SAME tile -- 144 against 133 GB/s on `gate_proj` at M = 14 -- which is the
#     contiguous activation read on its own.
#   * and `split_k` has to go. A split-K launch writes SPLIT_K x M x N fp32 partials and reads them
#     back: at M = 16 on `gate_proj` that is 8.9 MB written plus 8.9 MB read against 50.1 MB of
#     weight, a 36 % traffic surcharge that is LINEAR IN M and invisible at M = 1 where it is 1.1 MB.
#     That, not the tiling, is the M curve both kernels were showing. `split_k = 1` with a wider N
#     tile and more warps takes v2 from 144 to 199 GB/s at M = 14.
#
# Every entry is the cold winner at M = 14-16, which is the width the shipped router submits.

    48 SMs, and a verify runs **one kernel at a time**: the tail of every launch is SMs going idle
    while the last programs finish, and there are eleven launches a layer to pay it on.

    More programs per launch is the cheapest way to get more kernels in flight, and three sets of
