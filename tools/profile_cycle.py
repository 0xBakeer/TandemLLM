"""One full speculative block cycle, phase by phase, under the shipped configuration.

The row's mean is 32.13 tok/s and its median is 23.26, and the loop that produces both moves
about 15 GB in a 92 ms step -- 163 GB/s -- while the kernels it is made of reach 211-235 on their
own. The gap is not in any kernel. It is in the glue between them: Python between launches, the
two host round-trips the loop takes every block (`.tolist()` on the picks, `synchronize()` after
the commit), the drafter that runs strictly before the verify rather than beside it, and the
per-block tensor construction on the host.

This script measures where the gap is, under the exact configuration `server/app.py` ships, and
it reports three readings of the same blocks:

  loose   no extra synchronisation. CPU wall per phase, which is what the loop actually spends,
          and the only honest total. A phase that launches work and returns reads as cheap here
          and the cost lands on whichever later phase waits for it.
  strict  a `cuda.synchronize()` at every phase boundary. Attribution is exact and the total is
          inflated by the syncs it adds -- the difference between the two totals is itself the
          measurement of how much the loop currently overlaps.
  kernels `torch.profiler` over the same blocks, summed by kernel. Wall minus kernel time is the
          idle share, and that is the number this step is trying to close.

Everything here decodes greedily with thinking off, and both widths are warmed before anything is
timed: the first configuration in a fresh process pays for Triton autotuning and phase 6 lost a
day to reading that as a policy win.
