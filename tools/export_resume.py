"""A servable drafter out of a trainer's RESUME state, for a run that never wrote a checkpoint.

The 2026-09-17 learning-rate sweep (TRN-6) was cancelled on instruction before its export step, so
the one configuration that lifted every class on the held-out gate -- ft-b8 at `lr 3e-5`, 8,000
steps, 4.248 accepted a block against the released drafter's 4.100 -- exists only as
`train/lrprobe/state/resume-lr3e5.pt` in the bucket: weights, both Adam moments, the step and the
data cursor, 11 GB. The Spark needs the weights and nothing else.

    python tools/export_resume.py --state stage/resume-lr3e5.pt \
        --base ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--z-lab--Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2/snapshots/<rev> \
        --out stage/ft-b8-lr3e5

The base is the drafter the run STARTED from. Every tensor the resume state carries replaces the
base's; a tensor it does not carry is taken from the base, and those are listed, because the
trainer holds the selector codebooks frozen and a state that silently lacked a TRAINED tensor would
export the released weights under a fine-tune's name. `--require-all-trained` is the guard for
that: every key the state carries must exist in the base with the same shape, and nothing outside
`candidate_selector.` may come from the base.

The config is the base's with `block_size` set to the block the run trained at, which is what
`tools/train_dflash2.py::export` does; a MANIFEST.json records where the weights came from.
