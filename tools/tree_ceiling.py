"""How fast could a draft tree possibly go? The ceiling, from the drafter's own candidate sets.

A chain accepts position l only where the drafter's top-1 is the target's token. A tree accepts it
wherever the target's token is among the candidates the tree carries at that slot. So a chain is
bounded by P(argmax) and a tree by **top-k coverage**, and the gap between those two numbers is the
entire size of the prize -- before any question of what a verify step costs.

`tools/record_lattice.py` writes the block drafter's candidate sets at EVERY position of a trace,
and they are exact: the lattice at position p depends only on the committed prefix, and in a
lossless engine the committed prefix is the greedy prefix whatever the drafting policy was. So this
file computes, not estimates:

  * `coverage[l][k]` -- how often the target's token at slot l is in that slot's top k;
  * for a branching vector `(b_0 .. b_{L-1})`, the EXACT distribution of accepted run length, by
    replaying every recorded position rather than multiplying marginals. Coverage at slot l is not
    independent of coverage at slot l-1 and a product of marginals gets it wrong in both directions;
  * the best branching under a node budget, and what that is worth in tokens per second under the
    measured verify curve and under a flattened one.

The node count of a branching vector is `SUM_l PROD_{j<=l} b_j`: the tree carries the top `b_l`
candidates at slot l under every surviving parent. The candidate SET at a slot does not depend on
the parent -- it is a top-k over the head's logits for that row -- so a path is in the tree exactly
when each of its tokens is in its slot's top `b_l`. That is what makes the replay exact.
