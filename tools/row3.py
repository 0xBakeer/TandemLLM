"""The atlas row, N times a configuration, reported as a median and a spread.

Phase 9 compared two configurations by running the row once on each, read a 7 % difference in the
mean, and drew a conclusion that evaporated when the *reverted* configuration was run a third time
and read higher than the one that had just been blamed for the difference. Two runs of the same
engine differ by 10.4 % on the mean and 6.7 % on the median, because the row is fifty requests of
an ADAPTIVE policy: the latch decides each request's block width from timing taken inside that
request, so two runs make different decisions on the same prompts.

So a single row cannot decide anything smaller than about a tenth of itself, and the fix is not a
better formula -- it is more rows. This script runs the row `--runs` times a configuration,
recomputes every row from its own per-request records with the one formula

    tok/s = (completion_tokens - 1) / (e2e_s - ttft_s)

and reports, per configuration, the MEDIAN of the runs beside the spread of the runs, so that a
difference between two configurations can be read against the noise that produced it. A difference
smaller than the spread is not a result, and the script says so rather than leaving the arithmetic
to the reader.

**Use one server for all the runs of a configuration, which is the default.** Phase 9's three rows
of the release candidate came from three separate server processes and spread 10.4 % on the mean
and 6.7 % on the median; three rows of the same configuration through ONE process spread 5.9 % and
3.1 % (phase 10, 03:51). Most of the row's run-to-run noise is between processes rather than
between rows, so `--restart-each` -- which reproduces phase 9's procedure exactly -- roughly
doubles the noise the comparison has to beat. The one number it costs is `wall`: run 1 of a shared
server carries the Triton autotuning in its warm-ups and reads 20 % longer, while the fifty
measured requests do not, so compare on `mean` and `p50` and not on `wall`.

Two things it does that a shell loop does not. The atlas runner names its output file from a hash
of the configuration, so a second run of the same spec OVERWRITES the first: each run here gets its
own `--out` directory and its record is copied out under the run's own name. And the server is
started and torn down by PID rather than by pattern, on a port given on the command line, because
the release candidate serves on :8000 from another directory and must not be touched.
