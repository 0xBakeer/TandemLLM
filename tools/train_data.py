"""Record what the block drafter has to learn: the target's own hidden states, and what the
target then said.

The drafter is a conditional model of ONE distribution -- the target's greedy next token, given the
five residual streams the target leaves behind. Everything it needs can therefore be written down
once, offline, and read back without the target being resident. That is the whole reason a 27 B
target can be distilled into a 1.9 B drafter on a 121 GB board: training never runs the target.

WHAT A SAMPLE IS
----------------
One sequence of `N` tokens, and for every position `i` of it:

    fused[i]    the five tap tensors of `engine/model.py`, concatenated: [N, 5 * 5120] bf16.
                Tap invocation j is the residual stream ENTERING target layer j, so the five the
                drafter wants are invocations 5, 19, 33, 47, 61 -- see `drafters/dflash2.py`.
    label[i]    argmax of the target's logits at i, i.e. the token the target would emit next.
    top_ids[i]  the 64 most likely next tokens, and
    top_lp[i]   their log-probabilities. The block objective uses the argmax; the top-64 is what
                makes the soft term possible without storing a 248,320-wide row per position.

TWO KINDS OF SEQUENCE, AND WHY BOTH
-----------------------------------
`gen`     a prompt this tool built, followed by the target's OWN greedy continuation. This is the
          serving distribution exactly: the drafter at serve time conditions on hidden states of
          text the target itself produced. It is expensive -- 256 tokens at the engine's own decode
          rate -- so it is the smaller half.
`corpus`  a window of public text, teacher-forced in one prefill. The labels are still the target's
          argmax, not the corpus's next token, so the sample is still about the target; what is
          borrowed from the corpus is only the CONDITIONING text. At ~850 tok/s this is the bulk.

THE PROMPT SET
--------------
The bench row this program is measured against draws single-turn chat prompts of 256 tokens across
eleven topics, thinking off, temperature 0. This tool mirrors that SHAPE and nothing else: its
prompts are built here, from templates written in this file plus passages drawn from the public
corpus already on the board. The row's own prompts are never read, never tokenised and never
generated from. A drafter trained on the test set would report an acceptance nobody else could
reproduce, which is the same failure the ledger's 09:45 entry records for the lookup drafter's
corpus.

The held-out split is by sequence, declared in `manifest.json` and never crossed by the trainer:
`--holdout` of the `gen` sequences are marked `split: "heldout"` and are the only sequences the
acceptance gate is allowed to read, because only a self-generated sequence carries a greedy
continuation the simulation can walk.

Nothing personal is read. The corpus is public text (an encyclopedia dump and permissively licensed
Python), and the prompts are written in this file.
