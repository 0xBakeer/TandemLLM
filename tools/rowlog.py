"""The server log's per-request lines, read back: both factors of a request's speed, and where in
its blocks the draft went wrong.

Speed on this engine is committed tokens a block over block time. Since 2026-09-24 every `[req]`
line the server prints carries the decode loop's own count (`server/app.py::BlockStats`):

    [req] <id> json prompt=256 completion=256 finish=length 7712 ms 33.07 tok/s \
        blocks=78 committed=255 decode_ms=7289.4 accept=15:0x20,1x14,4x2|7:0x3,6x1

`blocks` is every forward of the decode loop (a verify, a declined single step, a forced close),
`committed` the tokens past the prefill's, `decode_ms` first token to last block. `accept` is the
first-miss histogram: per block that had a draft, `depth:accepted x count` -- how many draft tokens
the block could have accepted (a chain's length, a tree's depth) and how many it did. This module
is the one parser for all of it (`tools/row3.py`, `tools/accept_hist.py`).
