"""The block, itemised: every millisecond of one speculative block, what it reads, and how fast.

`tools/profile_cycle.py` splits a block into its phases. This splits the phases into their parts --
the MLP's three projections, the attention and linear-attention projections, the recurrence, the
attention core, the norms, the head over the verify rows, the drafter's backbone and head, the
commit, the drafter's context sync -- and prices each one against the board:

    bytes      what the part reads and writes, from the tensors it was handed (weights dominate)
    GB/s       bytes over the GPU time of the kernels it launched
    @235       the time the same bytes take at 235 GB/s, the practical ceiling of this board
    recover    GPU time minus @235 for a part that moves bytes; the whole GPU time for glue whose
               bytes are negligible (a fusion would delete it, not speed it up)

and it puts the host beside the device: a phase's wall clock minus the kernel time inside it is
time the GPU had nothing to do, and that is recoverable too, by removing a sync or overlapping.

HOW A KERNEL IS ATTRIBUTED. Each part runs inside a `record_function` whose name is its full path
(`verify/mlp/gate`, `draft/head`, ...). In the chrome trace a kernel carries a `correlation` id,
and so does the host-side launch call that issued it; the launch's timestamp falls inside exactly
the annotations that were open when it was issued, and the innermost one is the part. Launch time
rather than execution time, because the device runs behind the host and a kernel's own interval can
sit under a later annotation. The phases are traced STRICT (a sync at every boundary), so a kernel
launched in a phase also runs in it.

The wrappers are installed by this tool only and removed afterwards; the engine carries no
instrumentation. They cost host time under the profiler, which is why the wall-clock split comes
from an UNTRACED run of the same blocks and the traced run supplies only the device side.
