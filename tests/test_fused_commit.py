"""SPD-22: the block's commit with no state copies, against the engine without the flag.

With `QWEN38_FUSED_COMMIT` a chain verify does not clone the recurrent state: it reads the entry
state and writes its final one into a spare buffer, and the commit rebuilds the live state from
the entry for all layers at once. None of that may change a number. On a CPU the commit runs the
torch reference of the same identity (`tools/gdn_commit_kernels.commit_reference`), so these tests
check the plumbing -- which buffer is read, which is written, what a full accept leaves, what a
partial accept and a tree path leave -- on the random four-layer model of test_forward_tree.
The kernel's own arithmetic is `tools/gdn_commit_kernels.py check()` on the board.
