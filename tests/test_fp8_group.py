"""SPD-63/64: FP8Group -- a fused projection group of plain FP8 weights is the members, byte for byte.

`Weights.fuse_nvfp4_groups` (QWEN38_FUSE_PROJ=1) now also fuses a group whose members are all plain
`FP8Block`s. The fused weight is the members' codes and 128x128 scale tables concatenated along N;
every member becomes a view of its slice. On the CPU this checks the layout (the views, the scale
rows staying aligned), that the fused product's slices equal each member's own product, that the
members still work alone afterwards, and that a mixed NVFP4/FP8 group is left unfused. The board
check of the same identity on the Triton tile is `tools/fp8_probe.py --group`.
