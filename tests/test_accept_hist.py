"""CPU tests for tools/accept_hist.py and the histogram the length router writes for it.

The histogram travels as one token of a log line and is read back by a regex, so the one thing that
must hold is the round trip: what `LengthRouter.report()` writes is what `parse_log` reads, and the
cap rates are computed over the blocks that were actually counted.
