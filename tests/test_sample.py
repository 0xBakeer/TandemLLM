"""The sampler, unit-tested on a CPU (ENG-19).

What matters for the engine is that `temperature = 0` is the argmax it always was, and that a
sampled row follows the requested distribution: temperature scales, top-k truncates, top-p keeps
the smallest prefix whose mass exceeds the threshold, and a seed reproduces a request exactly.
None of that needs a model -- it is a function of one logits row.

The speculation half gets its own statistical gate: `chain_pick`/`tree_walk` must emit tokens
distributed exactly like direct sampling, because that is the property the pipeline sells
("verify_lossless, but for sampling"). With a deterministic drafter the accept rule is p(d) and
the residual is the draw itself, so the tests compare empirical histograms against the rows.
