"""The two pieces of new mathematics in the fused prefill path, on a CPU.

`tools/gdn_prefill_kernels.py` cannot be tested here -- it is Triton and it needs the board. What
CAN be tested without one is the reasoning the kernel is built on, and both parts of it are the
kind that look obviously true and are the reason a kernel is silently wrong:

  1. the UT transform's inverse as a DOUBLING SERIES rather than a forward substitution, and
  2. what the reference does to the PADDED TAIL of a sequence that is not a multiple of the chunk,
     which is what the kernel's masked loads have to reproduce.

Both are checked against `engine/gdn.py` and `torch.linalg.solve_triangular`, which are what the
shipped path uses.
