"""SPD-20 on the board: the skinny NVFP4 kernel against the exact product and against v2.

Run on the box under the lock (it needs CUDA): every projection shape the engine and the drafter
issue, every row count 1..16 plus 17, 24 and 32, both the served tile and the others the sweep
knows; row independence for EVERY row (not only row 0); odd tails in N and in the K split; zero
weights and a NaN activation that must stay in its own row; grouped weights with a scale per
column; and the flag-off path byte-identical to v2.
