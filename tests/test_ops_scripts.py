"""The two supervisor scripts, run for real against fake `curl`/`pgrep` (OPS, the pre-merge review).

Both faults here are the same shape: a file that outlives the thing it describes. `logs/loading.since`
outlived the loader whose load it was timing, and `.watchdog.off` outlived the hold that armed it --
and in both cases the survivor condemns whatever comes next, which on this box means a restart in
the middle of a 29 GB load, or no service at all until a timeout that is measured in tens of minutes.

`ops/watchdog.sh` and `ops/start.sh` are copied into a temporary directory beside a `serve.env` that
points at it, so the real scripts run with nothing real behind them: `curl`, `pgrep` and (on macOS,
where `stat -c` does not exist) `stat` come from a fake bin on the PATH, and `stop.sh`/`start.sh`
leave a marker instead of touching a board.

The process table is a fake too: `ops/engines.sh` reads `$ENGINE_PROC/<pid>/cmdline` and
`/exe`, and the sandbox points it at a directory of its own, so no test ever sees -- or signals --
the box's real engine. The fake `pgrep -f` searches the same table, which is how the scripts found
engines before.
