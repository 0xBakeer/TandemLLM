"""Sampled requests on the tree, exact -- on a CPU.

A sampled request's tree (`engine/tree.py::spine_tree`) is the drafter's SAMPLED chain as a spine,
each spine node carrying the distribution q its token was drawn from, with deterministic siblings
from the lattice. `Sampler.tree_walk` accepts a spine node with `min(1, p/q)`, otherwise draws from
the residual `(p - q)+` and follows any child carrying the draw: recursive rejection sampling with
the siblings as deterministic candidates. What has to hold:

  * the emitted tokens follow the target exactly: histograms of the first three emitted tokens over
    N = 30,000 walks on a Markov target match the chain's own probabilities, whatever q looks like
    and however many siblings a level has -- and a construction that picks its spine by the draw
    (the bias the causal builder exists to avoid) FAILS the same test, so the test can see it;
  * the builder is causal: siblings at depth i depend on the spine only down to depth i, the size is
    fixed before the draw, every spine node carries its q and no sibling does;
  * anything that reshapes a tree drops q (the walk is then the plain one, exact for any tree);
  * a seeded request ignores q and takes the keyed walk, so a seed still reproduces a request;
  * the router makes every choice on the deterministic tree, never on the sampled spine.
