"""The serving loop and its HTTP handler, on a CPU, with the random 4-layer model.

`server/app.py`'s `generate_stream` is its own copy of the decode loop -- a generator, so a token
reaches the socket the moment it is accepted -- and the gate tools never run it: they drive
`engine/spec.py`. So the claims about the SERVED loop are tested here, against the loop itself:

  * a pattern-stop hit inside the forced reasoning close ends the stream there, on every verify
    path, with the KV holding exactly what the stream says was written (SRV-18);
  * `X-Engine-Stop` reaches a non-streamed client, and a streamed one gets the marker in band
    instead, since its headers left before the guard fired (ENG-104);
  * the single-token step closes the reasoning block like the verified ones (SRV-19), and brings
    the drafter current like engine/spec.py's does (SRV-20);
  * a seed reproduces a sampled request whatever the drafter and the width choices do (ENG-103);
  * a graceful stop lets the generation in flight finish (SRV-21);
  * a failed non-streamed request is logged and counted like a streamed one (SRV-22);
  * a tool call written inside the reasoning block is not a call (SRV-23);
  * with thinking on, nothing a client can time as a first token goes out before the engine's
    first token: the synthetic `<think>` rides on the first text, and thinking off is untouched
    (SRV-16);
  * nor does the role chunk, thinking on or off: it goes out with the first text (SRV-24);
  * a streamed stop string never reaches the client, not even the part of it that arrives before
    the match, and a streamed answer with `stop` is the non-streamed one (SRV-25);
  * the `both` format closes the `<think>` it opens in `content` (SRV-26);
  * the `[req]` line carries the loop's own block count, decode time and first-miss histogram,
    for the chain and the tree, and a request that never generated carries none (SPD-35, SPD-36);
