"""Turning a growing list of token ids into text a client can be handed one piece at a time.

Three things live here rather than in `server/app.py`, and they are here together because all
three are the same mistake: **a token boundary is not a text boundary.** The engine decides tokens
and the protocol carries characters, and everywhere the server assumed those were the same thing it
produced something the reader could see was wrong.

1. **A character can span tokens.** The tokeniser is byte-level, so `🤦🏼` arrives as five tokens
   and the decoder shows a replacement character at three of the five prefixes:

       '🤦'  ->  '🤦�'  ->  '🤦�'  ->  '🤦🏼'

   A stream that emits `decoded[len(emitted):]` at every step sends the `�` the moment it
   appears and then never recovers: the next prefix is the same length, so the piece is empty, and
   the one after that is SHORTER in characters than what has already gone out. The reader is left
   with a permanent `�` where the modifier should be. `Detokenizer` holds the trailing
   incomplete run back until it resolves.

2. **The reasoning block opens in the prompt, not in the output.** The chat template's generation
   prompt ends `<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n`, so the model's first generated token is already
   inside the reasoning block and the only tag it ever writes is the closing one. A client that
   folds reasoning on `<think>...</think>` sees a stray `</think>` and folds nothing.
   `opens_think` says when that has happened and the server re-emits the opening tag.

3. **Not every client reads the tags.** `Reasoning` splits the stream at `</think>` so the same
   generation can be delivered as tagged text, as OpenAI-style `reasoning_content` deltas, or as
   both, without the generator knowing which.

Nothing here imports torch: it is string handling, and it is tested as string handling.
