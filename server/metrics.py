"""Prometheus metrics for this server, with no dependency and no edit to the decode loop.

`prometheus_client` is not installed on the board and the interpreter there has no pip, so the
exposition format is written out by hand. That is about eighty lines and it is the whole of the
format Prometheus 0.0.4 needs: a `# HELP` line, a `# TYPE` line, and one sample line per label set,
with histograms carrying cumulative `_bucket{le=...}`, a `_sum` and a `_count`.

WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM, because it is the part that decides whether they are true.

Nothing here is measured twice. Every counter is taken at a point the server already had:

  * `_log_request` runs once per generation, whatever happened to it, and already knows the prompt
    and completion counts, the finish reason and the wall time. It is the terminal counter.
  * `generate_stream` yields token ids as they are decided, so the gap between the call and the
    first yield is the time to first token and the gaps after it are the inter-token times.
  * the drafter is asked for a block (`propose` / `propose_tree`), told what the target committed
    (`observe`) and told what the verify cost (`on_verify`). Those three are the speculation
    counters, and the loop was calling all three already.

So this module wraps four functions rather than editing them, and `server/app.py` carries one
import and one `install()` call. That is deliberate: phase 9 is editing `app.py` for other reasons
and a hook scattered through its generation loop would collide with every one of those edits. The
cost of the wrappers is two `perf_counter()` calls and a few dictionary increments per block, on a
block that is 133 ms.

WHAT IS NOT HERE. The engine serves one sequence, so there is no batch, no KV utilisation and no
preemption to report; those metrics exist in vLLM because it has a scheduler and this server does
not. docs/roadmap.md says what would have to be true first. `qse_requests_waiting` is
the queue this server does have -- callers waiting for the one engine lock.

Names follow vLLM's set where the quantity is the same one, with a `qse_` prefix. Units are in the
name and they are seconds and bytes, never milliseconds, because that is what the format expects.
